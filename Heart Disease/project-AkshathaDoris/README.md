## DSSB Project on Heart Disease Dataset.
Team of two working on the final project on Heart Disease Dataset. Programming language used for this purpose is R.



### Introduction and explanations
- you have a good outline: a clear question and a dataset that is suitable to answering it.
- However several important variables are not explained, which facilitated errors later on


### visualisations, modelling and wrangling
- Overall, the visualisations and modelling suit the alanysis well
- however, several important variables are multinomial, but coded as numeric
- this makes for some clumsy visualisations and some inaccurate modelling
- also, check whether the prop-table options are really set to show the outcome you wanted


### Layout
- The order of plots and explanations was not always 100% coherent.
